# 🔍 Real-Time Object Detection in Browser using JavaScript

A powerful **real-time AI object detection system** built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — running completely inside the browser with **TensorFlow.js**.

No backend.  
No Python.  
No installations.  

Just open and run.

## ▶️ How It Works

1. Loads the COCO-SSD model via TensorFlow.js
2. Captures live video feed (webcam / IP cam / screen)
3. Runs object detection per frame
4. Draws bounding boxes with confidence scores
5. Displays detected objects in real time

All processing happens **inside your browser**.

## 📦 Usage

```bash
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser
3. Allow camera or screen access
4. Start detecting objects instantly
⚠️ Works best in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge)
